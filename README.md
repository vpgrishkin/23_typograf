The typograf prepares your text for web-publish.
It does the most routine operations, for example:
- replacement of quotes ' and " to « »;
- in the right places, replace hyphens with dashes;
- replacement of hyphens with short dashes in telephone numbers;
- linking numbers with subsequent words with an indissoluble space;
- removing extra spaces and line breaks;
- linking any words of 1-2 characters followed by words.
